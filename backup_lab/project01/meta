# Meta Information


|Summary|The goal of this project is to draw a forest scene from two basic shape primitives: a rectangle and a triangle. |
|Topics | Functions, loops, randomization and turtle graphics|
|Audience | Appropriate for CS1|
|Difficulty| This is an intermediate to advanced assignment, taking 1 or 2 weeks for a CS1 student.|
|Strengths| The strength of this assignment is that students see the concept of composition of code via functions visually with very basic elements.|
|Weaknesses| Students may find debugging time consuming if they don't strategically isolate parts of their drawings |
|Dependencies| Requires students to know the basics of Turtle Graphics in Python|
