<li markdown="1">
Section 2.1 describes how several operators and built in functions in
Python work.  What would be the result of entering the following at
the Python interactive shell prompt?

(Note: You are encouraged to check your answers at the Python prompt
before turning in your work, but try this on paper first, just by
reading the text and trying to predict what will happen.  Then try
typing in the results at the Python prompt.  Change your answers if
they were mistaken, but even more important, try to figure out why you
were incorrect.)

Be very precise.  Note that `True` is not the same in Python as `true`; upper
vs. lower case matters.  You will not get full credit for answers that are not
precisely correct.

<li style="margin-bottom:5em;" markdown="1">
(5 pts) As described in section 2.1, a Python assignment statement contains the assignment operator, an expression and a variable, but not in that order.

What is the correct order for these three parts, reading from left to right?

</li>


<li style="margin-bottom:5em;" markdown="1">
(5 pts) Section 2.1 contains a list of thirty-three <em>reserved words</em> in Python that may not be used as the name of a variable.   You don't need to memorize this list, but you do need to know where to find it, either in the book, or online.  So, to be sure you can find it, list all of the Python reserved words that start with the letter `c` or `f`.
</li>

<li style="margin-bottom:5em;" markdown="1">
Section 2.2 describes strings in Python, including the concepts of "dictionary order" (also called "lexicographic order"), concatenation of strings, multiplication of strings times an integer, the `in` operator, the `not in` operation, the `len` function, and string indexing.  Review that material.

Then, assuming the following assignment statements have been entered at the Python prompt:

```python
school = "UCSB"
course = "CS8"
qtr = "M17"
```
</li>

<li markdown="1">
Indicate the value of each of these expressions:

<style>
div.evenbigger table * td { padding: 2em 1pt 2em 1pt; text-align: center; }
div.evenbigger table * th { padding: 0em 1pt 0em 1pt; margin: 0 0 0 0; text-align:center;}
div.evenbigger table * td code { padding: 0pt 1em 0pt 1em; }
span.wider { padding: 0pt 6em 0pt 6em; }
</style>

<div class="evenbigger" markdown="1">

| | Expression  | <span class="wider">Result</span> | | | Expression  | <span class="wider">Result</span> |
|---------|-------------|--------|-|--------|-------------|--------|
| (4 pts) | `school * 2`        |  | | (4 pts) | `school > course` | |
| (4 pts) | `qtr[1:3]`          |  | |(4 pts) | `qtr < school`   | |
| (4 pts) | `course[0:2]`        |  | |(4 pts) | `len(qtr) > 4`   | |
| (4 pts) | `'D' in school`     |  | |(4 pts) | `school[-1]`     | |
| (4 pts) | `'E' not in school` |  | |(4 pts) | `school[0]`      | |

</div>

<li markdown="1">  As discussed in Section&nbsp;2.4, the `type()` function returns the type of a Python value.
When you pass a variable such as `x`, `type(x)` returns the type of the value that the variable `x` currently refers to.

Assume that the following assignment statement has been executed:

```
schools=["UCSB","Stanford","UCSD","Cal Poly"]
```

What will each of the expressions below evaluate to?  As a reminder, strictly speaking, Python will print types in the format `<class 'int'>`, `<class 'float'>`, `<class 'str'>`, etc. so *please use exactly that format* for full credit.
<style>
div.bigger table * td { padding: 0.7em 3pt 0.7em 3pt; }
span.wide { padding: 0pt 4em 0pt 4em; }
</style>

<div class="bigger" markdown="1">

| Points  | Expression  | <span class="wide">Result</span> | Points  | Expression  | <span class="wide">Result</span> |
|---------|-------------|--------|---------|-------------|--------|
| (4 pts) | `type(3)` |        | (4 pts) | `type(1+2.5)`     |        |
| (4 pts) | `type('3')`    |        | (4 pts) | `type(2 * "3")`|        |
| (4 pts) | `type("3.5")`    |        | (4 pts) | `type((3,3))` |        |
| (4 pts) | `type(3.5)`    |        | (4 pts) | `type(schools)`  |        |
| (4 pts) | `type([3,5])`    |        | (4 pts) | `type(schools[0])`    |        |

</div>
</li>


<li style="margin-bottom: 4em;" markdown="1">
(10 pts) Assume that `cases` is the name of a variable with a `float` value that you want to convert to an integer value.    Write a Python expression that converts `cases` to an integer (throwing away any fractional part)
</li>



<li style="margin-bottom: 4em;" markdown="1"> (10 pts) Assume that `courseNum` is an integer that represents the numeric part of a course number (e.g. 3, 8, 130, 16, 24).    Write a Python expression that converts `courseNum` to an string (i.e. `<class 'str'>` in Python)
</li>


<li style="margin-bottom: 4em;" markdown="1"> (10 pts) If you want to check whether x is greater than 10, and y is greater than 5, you can write the Python expression

```python
(x > 10) and (y > 5)
```

If `x` has the value `20`, and `y` has the value `17`, this evaluates to `True`.

But what if we accidentally wrote it as:

```python
(x > 10) + (y > 5)
```

What would this expression evaluate to, assuming the same values for `x` and `y`)?  (The answer requires you to read the section carefully, and then apply what you have learned.    I suggest you try that first before trying it at the Python command line.)

</li>


<div class="pagebreak"></div>

<li>Both Sections 2.4 and 2.5 mention a type of function that is called a <em>constructor</em>.

<ol>

<li style="margin-bottom: 4em;" markdown="1">
(5 pts) In general, what do constructors do?  (Don't give an answer that is specific, for instance, to only the constructor for the `int` data type).

</li>


<li style="margin-bottom: 4em;" markdown="1">
(5 pts) <em>Before</em> using the constructor for a `Fraction` object, a particular line of Python code must be written.  What is that line of code?  (Be very careful about spelling and upper vs. lower case.)

</li>

<li style="margin-bottom: 4em;" markdown="1">
(10 pts) Assuming that line of code has been typed (the one mentioned in the previous question), how do you create a `Fraction` object that holds the fraction $$\frac{4}{5}$$ (i.e., "four&nbsp;fifths"), and makes the variable `ratio` refer to that object?

</li>
</ol>

<li style="margin-bottom: 4em;" markdown="1">
(10 pts) Write the full definition of a function that takes 3 float type of arguments as inputs, x, y, and z, and returns their sum, their average, and the square-root of their sum of squares. When called, for example, as <strong>myFunction(2.0, 3.0, 4.0)</strong>, it should print out the following (it does not have to *return* anything!):

```
The sum is: 9.0
The average is: 3.0
The square-root of their sum of squares is: 5.38516480713
```
